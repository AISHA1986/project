Past automation has both substituted and complemented labor; machines replaced humans at some lower-paying jobs (for example in agriculture), but this was compensated by the creation of new, higher-paying jobs.[66] Studies have found that computers did not create significant net technological unemployment.[67] Due to artificial intelligence being far more capable than computers, and still being in its infancy, it is not known whether it will follow the same trend; the question has been debated at length among economists and policymakers. A 2017 survey found no clear consensus among economists on whether AI would increase long-term unemployment.[68] According to the World Economic Forum's The Future of Jobs Report 2020, AI is predicted to replace 85 million jobs worldwide, and create 97 million new jobs by 2025.[69][70] From 1990 to 2007, a study in the U.S. by MIT economist Daron Acemoglu showed that an addition of one robot for every 1,000 workers decreased the employment-to-population ratio by 0.2%, or about 3.3 workers, and lowered wages by 0.42%.[71][72] Concerns about technology replacing human labor however are long-lasting.

The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products.

Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performances, as in the case of theatre or concerts, or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion, as with stage magic.

           "Whether you’re decorating your home for the first time or if it’s your tenth furnishing venture, the first room on your list should always be the living room. Not only do living rooms boast one of the larger floor spaces in your house, but it’s also a communal area where you entertain guests and relatives. It’s also where you and your family spend most of your time together – second only to the dining room or kitchen. Start with this room, and take the below notes to work through the rest of the rooms in your home.",

 descriptions4:[
 "Establish a Focal Point.",
"Rooms must not only be attractive and welcoming but a comfortable place to stay in. One of the first things you need to do is establish a focal point. Focal points can either be natural or artificial. Natural focal points include central points such as the fireplace or a very large window offering views of the outside to the room. Artificial focal points, on the other hand, are more diverse and can be furniture, a structure within the room, or even a piece of artwork. Take note that even if the room has an existing focal point, such as a window, you can draw the attention away to a new focal area through the creative use of decor. Eye-catching canvas prints or acrylic glass prints are the easiest type of decoration to turn into a new focal point, but you can use furniture as well.",


"Lighting.",

"Unlike other rooms, the importance of lighting in a room isn’t always immediate – especially if the room has a large window that provides natural lighting during the day. Rooms can thrive with just ambient lighting from a couple of standing lamps or even recessed lighting that is neatly hidden in the recesses of the walls or ceiling. If you’re using different types of lighting (such as a mixture of ambient, accent, and task lighting), they should be at different levels to avoid crowding.",

"Furniture Arrangement.",
"The biggest challenge when it comes to arranging room furniture is where to begin and how to get it right. It’s a common mistake to simply place a sofa or a chaise lounge right against the wall or prop up a coffee table in the very middle of the room. When arranging furniture, use your established focal point as a guide. If your designated focal area is on a corner of the room, for example, the furniture should neatly expand from the focal area into the rest of the room. You also certainly don’t want to arrange furniture that makes the room difficult to walk through. Simple rules include avoiding placing large and obstructive furniture near the transitionary areas of the room.",

"The Importance of Wall Art.",
"While less is often certainly more, empty walls in rooms exude an atmosphere of incompleteness that you don’t want to permeate. The presence of wall art that works in conjunction with the rest of the  room’s decor is not only eye-catching and attractive to look at, but it also ensures a cohesive look for the rest of the room. Hanging wall art in your home also helps you avoid filling the walls with decor that can crowd the room.",

"Colour Palette.",
"Finally, there’s the colour palette of your room. It’s ideally the last thing you should consider since, while painting is a difficult chore, it’s easier to find colours that match the room’s existing decor than the other way around. Use your primary focal points as well as the decorative pieces you’ve chosen for your room as a sort of colour guide so you can find an inspirational colour palette for your room."],

          "the term education originates from the Latin words educare, meaning to bring up, and educere, meaning to bring forth. The definition of education has been explored by theorists from various fields. Many agree that education is a purposeful activity aimed at achieving goals like the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. However, extensive debate surrounds its precise nature beyond these general features. One approach views education as a process occurring during events such as schooling, teaching, and learning. Another perspective perceives education not as a process but as the mental states and dispositions of educated individuals resulting from this process. Furthermore, the term may also refer to the academic field that studies the methods, processes, and social institutions involved in teaching and learning. Having a clear understanding of the term is crucial when attempting to identify educational phenomena, measure educational success, and improve educational practices."],

          descriptions2:[
            "Some theorists provide precise definitions by identifying specific features exclusive to all forms of education. Education theorist R. S. Peters, for instance, outlines three essential features of education, including imparting knowledge and understanding to the student, ensuring the process is beneficial, and conducting it in a morally appropriate manner. While such precise definitions often characterize the most typical forms of education effectively, they face criticism because less common types of education may occasionally fall outside their parameters. Dealing with counterexamples not covered by precise definitions can be challenging, which is why some theorists prefer offering less exact definitions based on family resemblance instead. This approach suggests that all forms of education are similar to each other but need not share a set of essential features common to all. Some education theorists, such as Keira Sewell and Stephen Newman, argue that the term education is context-dependent."],
          
          descriptions3:[

            "Evaluative or thick conceptions of education assert that it is inherent in the nature of education to lead to some form of improvement. They contrast with thin conceptions, which offer a value-neutral explanation. Some theorists provide a descriptive conception of education by observing how the term is commonly used in ordinary language. Prescriptive conceptions, on the other hand, define what constitutes good education or how education should be practiced. Many thick and prescriptive conceptions view education as an endeavor that strives to achieve specific objectives, which may encompass acquiring knowledge, learning to think rationally, and cultivating character traits such as kindness and honesty.",

          "Various scholars emphasize the importance of critical thinking in distinguishing education from indoctrination.They argue that indoctrination focuses solely on instilling beliefs in students, regardless of their rationality, whereas education also encourages the rational ability to critically examine and question those beliefs. However, it is not universally accepted that these two phenomena can be clearly distinguished, as some forms of indoctrination may be necessary in the early stages of education when the child's mind is not yet fully developed. This is particularly relevant in cases where young children must learn certain things without comprehending the underlying reasons, such as specific safety rules and hygiene practices.",

Teacher-centered definitions emphasize the perspective and role of the teacher in transmitting knowledge and skills in a morally appropriate manner.[21] On the other hand, student-centered definitions analyze education based on the student's involvement in the learning process, suggesting that this process transforms and enriches their subsequent experiences.[22] It's also possible to consider definitions that incorporate both perspectives.",
